title:  ibm and cloud foundry
---

As [announced last Wednesday](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/41569.wss), 
IBM will be collaborating with folks on the development of
[Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com/).  Here's 
[another write-up on the announcement](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2013/07/30/ibm-plus-cloud-foundry/), 
from Stephen O'Grady at RedMonk.

What does all this mean?  What will I be doing?

I don't know exactly. Something. Likely involving open source (yay!). 

More in a bit, I hope.
