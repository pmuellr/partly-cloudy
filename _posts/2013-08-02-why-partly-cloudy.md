title:  why partly cloudy?
---

I'm playing in a new topical area at work: "the cloud".  So it seemed like a
great time to collect all that stuff I'm doing in one place.

I wanted to play with a 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)-based 
site, and that's going pretty well.  A link to the source for this site is
available at the bottom of the page.

While the name "partly cloudy" may seem a bit negative, I will admit 
that as a sun-hater, I tend to enjoy "partly cloudy" days more than "mostly sunny"
days.  So, it's a positive for me.  

That, and I'm sure I'll also be posting some not-quite-cloud-y kinds of
things here anyway.
